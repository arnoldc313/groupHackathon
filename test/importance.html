<h2>Why is cleaning our ocean so important?</h2>

   <div class="col">These beaches need to be protected. If we raise money and get volunteers to help pick up trash we could save our wildlife and our beaches from air pollution. This could be detrimental to our environment and could be very harmful to humans. For our wildlife, it is clear that it is harmful, but what exactly does this mean? The trash in the ocean can harm “physical habitats, transport chemical pollution, threaten aquatic life, and interfere with human use of the river, marine and coastal environments.” Plastic pollution has impacted at least 267 species worldwide, including 86% of all sea turtle species, 44% of all seabird species, and 43% of all marine mammal species.” This is so harmful to everyone who is by or in the seas. Just simply picking up trash by our ocean and around it can have such a huge impact on our environment.

       <p>Wildlife has a huge role in keeping the environment balanced and alive. It provides a “sense of stability” to different parts of nature. It said that wildlife and nature correspond together in order to help humans with emotional and social reasons. They help humans survive on earth. We as humans are also a part of wildlife to “make ecological balance on earth.” Another reason why it is important to keep our ocean clean is because of climate change. Climate change is very important to think about because it predicts future climate expectations. Too much climate can hurt wildlife and humans. Having a healthy and clean ocean can regulate climate change and reduce climate change from getting too high. The ocean will also absorb “90% of the heat and approx. 30% of carbon dioxide emissions produced by human activities.”</p>

     <p>Sealife is so beautiful and fascinating because there is so much about the ocean that we don’t know. We can spend hours researching and discover more and more about the ocean and still not know everything about it. The unknown world that is the ocean needs to be protected. Not just for sea animals but for humans as well. It is said that by the year 2030, climate change will spike up and this will be a catastrophe for marine life. This is a serious issue because if the water temperatures go up it will be hard for the marine life to get oxygen in the water and won’t be able to live in their habitats and will be forced to “migrate.” An article from Plant Aid, states that if humans are exposed to dangerous chemicals for a long period of time, people will develop major health problems and a lot of people could die. These diseases include, “hormonal issues, reproductive issues, and damage to our nervous systems and kidneys.” </p>

   <p>There are a lot of positives when it comes to keeping our oceans cleaned. As humans, the sunlight and being out with families in nature are so important. According to a study done by “Sage Environment and Behavior'' states that “visits to the beach increase well-being and as far as beach activities go, people feel cleaning the beach is a more meaningful activity than simply walking the beach.” Helping our environment and keeping it clean should be a normal and regular thing being a human being. Removing debris from the ocean (like I stated prior) will help reduce diseases and help marine life. Debris can consist of anything from plastic bags, microplastics, fabrics, etc. At the end of the day, the ocean is a beautiful place. It deserves and needs to be protected and cherished as much as we can. We should show our future generation how to take care of the ocean by setting a good example. </p>
