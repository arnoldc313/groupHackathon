  <h1>Solution</h1>
  <p>For the solution for cleaning beaches we need people to volunteer to help clean beaches and pollution so people
    won't become sick and have a virus and also for animals to not get sick from polluted waste, that can really hurt
    the ecosystem badly from trash
    . People can log on to our website and schedule a clean up for a beach on a specific day.
    Other people may sign up to help that beach clean up as well.
    Funded by donations and partners, materials such as trash bags and gloves will be provided.
  </p>

  <p>Also another solution would be not to throw away trash on beaches and instead have
    more trash cans on the beach and have those trash cans
    taken out immediately so beaches don't have any issues.
 
    There will be a point system that will earn you
    gift cards, T- shirts,clothes and other rewards as well for helping, to incentivize volunteers to help out.
    Points will be rewarded based on how big the beach is.
    Bonus points will be given out when there are more people helping to clean the beach, which can encourage people to
    invite

  <p>their friends to help as well.
    The rewards are also funded through donors and our partners.
 
    Another solution would be to help clean up rivers that's connected to
    beaches so trash will not be floating the streams and animal
    populated areas, that could ruin ecosystems and eventually
    hurt a lot of animals on the way.
