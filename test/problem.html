              There are many harmful effects that come from beach pollution. Some of which are illnesses, climate change, and economic losses. Over time, these harmful effects will accumulate and become worse. Tourists and people who go on vacations spend millions of dollars total and without beaches this could harm the economy as well. There are existing solutions such as Ocean Conservancy, but there is a better way of handling it. There are many more harmful effects as well as solutions that come from beach pollution.

              <h2>How It Occurs</h2>

              One of the ways beach pollution occurs is through sewage. It can enter the water through a leak in the sewage system and can carry bacteria such as E. coli. Another way that it occurs is through plastics. This can be plastic water bottles or anything that is mainly made of plastic. They persist in the environment and can be ingested by animals which later reach us due to the food chain. One final way that it enters the ocean is oil pollution. The oil enters it through an oil spill or through ships. This can be harmful because it can be harmful to humans when it reaches the beach.

              Beach pollution can have a lot of negative impacts in the future. Mainly, it can accumulate over time and worsen the effects that they already have. Beach pollution is also linked to other major issues such as coral reefs dying. If beach pollution gets worse, so will the other major issues in the world. Eventually more and more beaches will be polluted, and all tourist money will be lost and can damage the economy along with the environment. Beach pollution also affects climate change and can make its effects a lot worse, such as rising sea level.

      According to condorferries.co.uk, there are an estimated 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic in the oceans. This can be especially damaging to the environment as well as beaches since these plastics typically wash up onto the shore. Approximately 100 million marine animals die to plastic yearly. This can affect the sea food that we eat because the plastics consumed by fish work their way to us in the food chain. Scientists say that by 2050 there will be more discarded plastic in the ocean than fish. Not only are the health effects increased but this practically eliminates all tourism revenue in certain areas with beaches.

      <h1>Existing Solutions</h1>

      One of the existing solutions for beach clean ups is surfrider.org. This solution is great but it could be better since it does hire volunteers but it doesn’t incentivize them. Another solution is Ocean Conservancy, but the only option they give is to donate. This won’t be very helpful to someone who wants to help clean the ocean themselves. Another solution is the Ocean Blue project which is very similar, however they are a nonprofit so none of the money donated goes towards them.

      <h1>More Solutions</h1>

      There are other ways a person can help solve the problem without having to donate. One of which is to recycle plastics, such as water bottles. Although it is small it can be effective if everyone does it. Another small solution would be to use less plastics in general. There are many non-plastic alternatives for basic items in stores. It is better if these items are reusable and nondisposable, so that you can guarantee it won't end up in any beach.
